    "contents" : "Crosstab\n\nRecreating in Tableau:\n\nThe crosstab can be recreated in tableau by putting geographical area\nin the rows section and above median spending in the columns section. To\nthe above median spending, find the median value for the states and create\na calculated field that will give the true/false value if the number is above\nor beneath the median spending. Then, add the text Sum(Spending per child) in the text section underneath\nmarks. Color the crosstab with Above Average Enrollment per state population\nby using a calculated field to determine the average enrollment per state population\nand then using another calculated field to determine the true/false value of\neach enrollment/population.\n\nInteresting Things:\n\nNotice how most states above average median spending have a below average\nenrollment per population. These states spend more on their child and have\nless children in each state. Some interesting things to point out would be\nthat big states such as California and Texas have a huge population and\nspends less on each children. In addition, another interesting thing would\nbe how the state of utah is way below the median spending per child and\nit is above in terms of child enrollment over population. Furthermore,\nmost of the northeastern states have an above median spending per child\nas compared to the southern states.",
