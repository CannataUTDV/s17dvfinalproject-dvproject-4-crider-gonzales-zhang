Crosstab

Recreating in Tableau:

The crosstab can be recreated in tableau by putting geographical area
in the rows section and above median spending in the columns section. To
the above median spending, find the median value for the states and create
a calculated field that will give the true/false value if the number is above
or beneath the median spending. Then, add the text Sum(Spending per child) in the text section underneath
marks. Color the crosstab with Above Average Enrollment per state population
by using a calculated field to determine the average enrollment per state population
and then using another calculated field to determine the true/false value of
each enrollment/population.

Interesting Things:

Notice how most states above average median spending have a below average
enrollment per population. These states spend more on their child and have
less children in each state. Some interesting things to point out would be
that big states such as California and Texas have a huge population and
spends less on each children. In addition, another interesting thing would
be how the state of utah is way below the median spending per child and
it is above in terms of child enrollment over population. Furthermore,
most of the northeastern states have an above median spending per child
as compared to the southern states.
