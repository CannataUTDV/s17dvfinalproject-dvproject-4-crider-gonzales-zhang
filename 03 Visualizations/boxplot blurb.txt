Boxplot

Recreating in Tableau:

To recreate in Tableau, first uncheck aggregate measures and drag the
spending per child onto the rows section. Next, determine the median spending
per child and create a calculated field that outputs a true/false value
to determine the above median spending per child. Drag the above median
spending per child to the columns section and on the show me click on the
box pot diagram.

Interesting Points:

For this graph, it shows that the states that are below the median do not
deviate too much from one another. However, the states that spend above
the median have huge ranges. For instance, one of the
biggest outliers is the district of columnbia which could be due to the small population of children
vs. the amount of money in the region.
