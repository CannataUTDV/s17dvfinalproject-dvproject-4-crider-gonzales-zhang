Elementary Spending and Bachelors Attainment 1 & 2

These bar graphs show per pupil spending by state and are separated and colored by whether or not they have a relatively high rate of
bachelor degree attainment amon their residents. The aim of this visualization is to point out a possible correlation or lack thereof between elementary investment by the state and continuing education of its residents.

To recreate this Visualization, Drag 2014 PPCS onto Columns, State on to rows, and select a Bar graph.
To color and filter, create a calculated field on 2014 PPCS named "PPCS to Avg" with the following code:

IF SUM([2014 PPCS]) > WINDOW_AVG(SUM([2014 PPCS]))
    THEN 'HIGH'
ELSE 'LOW'

END

and drag it to filters, then create a calculated field on Bachelors titled "Relative_Bachelors" using the following code:

IF [Bachelors] > 500000  * WATCH OUT FOR A TABLEAU ERROR IN WHICH BACHELORS IS MISSPELLED/MISLABELED - ADJUST ACCORDINGLY
    THEN 'HIGH'

ELSE 'LOW'

END

and drag it to color. Finally, drag Bachelors to Label.


Per Pupil Spending Range HIST:

This is a simple histograme representing the distribution of per pupil elementary school spending by state. Notice that the histogram is most dense around 8-10k per pupil.

To recreate this visualization in tableau, simply click on Bachelors and choose Histogram view under 'show me'




State Elementary Spending to Higher Ed:

This bar graph displays the states along with their ratios of per pupil spending to bachelors attainment. While seemingly a curious choice for a ratio, it is effective in displaying what if any correlation there may be between state elementary spending and higher education attainment. The kpi used helps give a general notion of which states invest most heavily in elementary education and where it seems to pay off or not.

To recreate this graph in tableau:
Create a calculated field on Bachelors named 'Higher_ed/Spending Ratio' using the following code:

[Higher_ED] / [2014 PPCS]

and drag it to rows. Drag State to Columns. Drag 'Higher_Ed/Spending Ratio' to color
